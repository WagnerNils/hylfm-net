# HyLFM-Net

## Requirements
- [CUDA-enabled GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute)
- Linux OS (tested on CentOs Linux 7 (Core))
- [[mini]conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) (tested with miniconda 4.8.4)

## Installation
##### Clone repository
Clone and navigate to this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:kreshuklab/hylfm-net.git
cd hylfm-net
```

##### Install hylfm conda environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
##### Install time
The install time greatly depends on download speed (several hundred MB).<br>
üïê Without download (or very fast download), the [installation](#install-hylfm-conda-environment) takes around **9 min**.

## Demo
##### Activate hylfm conda environment
```
conda activate hylfm
```

##### Choose a CUDA device
When running hylfm ([train](#train-hylfm-net-on-beads) or [test](#test-hylfm-net-on-beads)) a CUDA device will be used. Run `nvidia-smi` to see available CUDA devices on your machine. If more than one CUDA device is available you need to specify which one to use either bei setting the 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES' environment variable or by command line argument `--cuda`:
```
python -m hylfm --cuda <cuda device, e.g. 0> ...
```

#### Train HyLFM-Net on beads
```
python -m hylfm configs/train/beads/z_out51/small_f8.yml
```
üïê Excluding download time, this training configuration runs for approximately **1,5 days** (on a GTX 2080 Ti).


#### Test HyLFM-Net on beads
Download (to hylfm-net/download).
```
python -m hylfm configs/test/beads/z_out51/small_f8.yml --checkpoint small_beads_demo
```
üïê Excluding download time, this test configuration runs for approximately **6,5 min** in total with 12 s per sample (on a GTX 2080 Ti). Most time is spend on computing metrics specified in `configs/metrics/beads.yml`.


##### Monitoring with TensorBoard
With default settings and in the [hylfm repository directory](#clone-repository), run
```
$ tensorboard --logdir=logs
```
which will yield an output like:
```
TensorBoard 1.15.0 at <address>:<port> (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
With the TensorBoard running, open `<address>:<port>` in your browser to see logged scalars (screenshot from [training](#train-hylfm-net-on-beads)):<br>

Switch to `<address>:<port>/#images` for 2d (and max projections of 3d) tensors and plots (screenshot from [testing](#test-hylfm-net-on-beads)):<br>

## On Your Data
- Write a `get_tensor_info` function in `hylfm/datasets/local/<your dataset group>.py` analogously to `hylfm/datasets/local/example.py`.
- Write a config yaml file in `configs` analogously to `configs/train/beads/z_out51/small_f8.yml`.
    - Use tensors from \<your dataset group\>:
   
        in demo `small_f8.yml`:
        ```yaml
        - tensors: {lf: beads.small_0, ls_reg: beads.small_0}
        ```
        
        in your `configs/**/<your config>.yml`:
        ```yaml
        - tensors: {<name>: local.<your dataset group>.<tag>, <other name>: local.<your dataset group>.<tag>}
        ```

- Train or test HyLFM-Net as described in [Demo](#demo).
